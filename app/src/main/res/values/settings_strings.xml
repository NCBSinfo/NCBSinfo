 <b>NCBSinfo</b> is an application for regular use, especially helpful for people working at the National Centre for Biological Science (NCBS), Bangalore.
    Our aim is to create a mobile application, which will serve as an application-cum-database for important information pertaining to NCBS. With the help of this, we will try to reduce the time spent on searching for shuttle timings and contact numbers.

        Best part of an open source app is that you will know exactly what is going on inside the app. We encourage you to check
        our source code on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/NCBSinfo/NCBSinfo"> https://github.com/NCBSinfo/NCBSinfo </a>). Code is heavily commented for readability.
        We ask for following permissions from you

       Dear app user, <br> </br><br> </br>
        The NCBSinfo project started as a small personal app in December 2016, which I had used to track shuttle timings in NCBS.
        Soon it\'s user base expanded and now (as of December 2018) it has almost 450 daily users and more than 1000 installs.
        Unfortunately, now I can not dedicate more time for maintaining this app and have to stop further development. However,
        to make this self-sustained, I have added a solid foundation for editing and managing one\'s own timetable. If you
        are not aware of this function, please check \'Manage Transport\' option from \'Information\' section. You will be able to
        use this app smoothly, even if there are any changes in transport timings. One can even create their own routes.
        I will fix (any) bugs and timetable changes until 16 October <strike>2019</strike> 2020. If anyone is interested in developing
        this app further, feel free to contribute to this open source app on <a href="https://github.com/NCBSinfo/NCBSinfo"> GitHub</a>.
        If you have any suggestion or feedback, please drop me an email on <a href="mailto:contact@secretbiology.com">contact@secretbiology.com</a> or
        <a href="mailto:ncbs.mod@gmail.com">ncbs.mod@gmail.com</a>. <br> </br> <br> </br> I am very
        grateful for all the love and encouragement provided by you. I hope this app will also help you in the future.
        Thank you!<br> </br> Bidding Adieu!!
        <br> </br><br> </br>
        Yours<br> </br>
