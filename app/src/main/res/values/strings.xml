    <string name="about_us"><![CDATA[ <b>NCBSinfo</b> is an application for regular use specially helpful for people working at the National Centre for Biological Science (NCBS), Bangalore.
    Our aim is to create a mobile application which will serve as an application-cum-database of important timings pertaining to NCBS. With the help of this we will try to reduce the time spent on searching useful information like shuttle timings and contact numbers.]]></string>

    <string name="terms"><![CDATA[ This is <b>NOT</b> an official NCBS app and has been created ONLY for personal use.
    All the information (except event updates) provided in this application was last updated on 1 May 2016. Though a lot of effort has been taken to curate the information,
    minor discrepancies may still exist. Developers are not responsible for any such information presented/conveyed through this application.
    In case of any bug/error(s), please report it to the developers; measures will be taken to rectify the same. ]]></string>

    <string name="faq"><![CDATA[
    &#8226; <b>Some of components of UI are looking weird</b> <br> </br>
      This application is not designed for all screen sizes (yet). Hence it is possible to see weird or misplaced UI components. <br> </br><br> </br>
      &#8226; <b>I am not able to receive any notifications from events</b> <br> </br>
      Please check if you have any task managers which is killing NCBSinfo app. If that is the case, add this app into white-list. <br> </br> <br> </br>
       &#8226; <b>There is nothing in event section</b> <br> </br>
       This can happen if there are no events retrieved from the server. App will make request to data server depending on your network settings and will retrieve data.
       If you want to manually sync your app, go to developers options and click on "Sync Data now".]]></string>
