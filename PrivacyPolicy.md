# Privacy Policy

In short,

We **DO NOT** collect **ANY** personal information. 


#### Details

 ``SecretBiology`` built the **Information about NCBS** app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by ``SecretBiology`` at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. 

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Information about NCBS unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy. 

#### Information Collection and Use

We do not collect ANY information from our users who are using our android app. However, we do use few third party libraries which might collect some identifiable information. Please check their privacy policies for the more details. Following are third party services we use (and why?),

**Firebase Crashalytics**
We can not test our application on all possible devices and various configurations. Hence, there is chance that few bugs might creep in. To hunt these bugs and remove them, we need to know details regarding any crashes or errors occurred while using our app. To achieve that we use Firebase Crashalytics service which sends us anonymous crash reports. This will send us anonymous crash report ONLY if you have allowed us to collect it. You can change this from settings section. Check out their privacy policy [here](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics/). 



However, you can use **full features** of our app without using these services. You can just block internet access to this app and none of these services will work! If you have further doubts, suggestions or feedback, please contact us on [contact@secretbiology.com](mailto:contact@secretbiology.com)
